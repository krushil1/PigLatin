# PigLatin 

1. Make sure you know how pig Latin works. 
a. If a word starts with a vowel, add the word "way" at the end of the word
b. If a word starts with a consonant then a vowel, put the first letter of the word at   the end and add "ay"
c. If a word starts with two consonants move the two consonants to the end of the word and add "ay"

2. Prompt the user for three separate words where each word meets one of the criteria. For example, "Please enter a word that starts with a vowel"
3. Your program should change the words into pig Latin using String methods. Convert all words to lowercase before printing them.
4. Display the three words in pig Latin.
